# Binary Classification of Lung Cancer using miRNA Expression and a Deep Neural Network
 This project is inspired by the thesis work of the author, "**Monitoring Lung Cancer Response to Therapy via Exosomal miRNA Profiling**" by Josh Stanton under supervision Dr. Tony Reiman and Dr. Alli Murugesan. 
 
 **Abstract:** *Treatment for lung cancers can be difficult due to the aggressive nature of the disease and the current challenge posed by the expensive, invasive, and potentially unreliable monitoring of therapy response via computed tomography (CT) scans. In recent years, blood exosomal miRNA has been used to search for diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers and suggests an interesting potential alternative monitoring method through blood sampling as a form of “liquid biopsy”. In small studies, miRNAs have previously demonstrated prognostic value in cancer patients receiving a given therapy; however, the value of serial blood exosomal miRNA profiling in assessing treatment response has not been well studied. Through the use of exosomes extracted from the blood plasma of 45 lung cancer patients and TaqMan Array PCR miRNA analysis, we show a panel of four exosomal miRNAs that may be beneficial in determining treatment response in lung cancer patients. Exosomal miRNAs miR-181c-3p, miR-500a-3p, miR-99a-5p, and miR-10b-5p were significantly upregulated in the lung cancer cohort before treatment as compared to controls, and miR-181c-3p was significantly downregulated after treatment. However, we were unable to detect a correlation between changes in exosomal miRNA profiles post treatment and clinical response to therapy, in part due to the small size of the study and the challenges of assessing response to therapy using CT scans.  This study has provided the groundwork for further evaluation of an exosomal miRNA panel to monitor treatment response in advanced lung cancer. The study has also generated hypotheses regarding miRNA families as lung cancer biomarkers, to be further investigated.*
 
 The basis for the present project is to instead take the concepts developed in the thesis and assess a deep neural network's abilities to predict a patient having lung cancer based on the miRNA expression presented. Using TensorFlow, Keras, and open-sourced miRNA transcriptome datasets hosted by the National Institutes of Health Cancer Genome Atlas, a deep neural network was trained in batches to determine which selection of training data would produce the most accurate predictions. 
 
 The miRNA selected for specific training batches were based on the findings of the aforementioned thesis:
 
 Batch #1: No specifications of miRNA, trained on entire dataset.
 
 Batch #2: Selected miRNAs were found to be significantly upregulated in patients with lung cancer prior to their chemotherapy/radiation therapy treatment ('hsa-mir-181c', 'hsa-mir-500a', 'hsa-mir-99a', 'hsa-mir-10b').

 Batch #3: Selected miRNAs were used to test the hypothesis generated from the aforementioned thesis. The hypothesis being that lung cancer causes dysregulation in miRNA expression on a wider level through grouping via "families" as opposed to individual, specific dysregulation of expression ('hsa-let-7a-1', 'hsa-let-7a-2', 'hsa-let-7a-3', 'hsa-let-7b', 'hsa-let-7c', 'hsa-let-7d', 'hsa-let-7e', 'hsa-let-7f-1', 'hsa-let-7f-2', 'hsa-let-7g', 'hsa-let-7i', 'hsa-mir-130a', 'hsa-mir-130b', 'hsa-mir-30a', 'hsa-mir-30b', 'hsa-mir-30c-1', 'hsa-mir-30c-2', 'hsa-mir-30d', 'hsa-mir-30e', 'hsa-mir-323a', 'hsa-mir-323b', 'hsa-mir-181a-1', 'hsa-mir-181a-2', 'hsa-mir-181b-1', 'hsa-mir-181b-2', 'hsa-mir-181c', 'hsa-mir-181d', 'hsa-mir-500a', 'hsa-mir-500b', 'hsa-mir-10a', 'hsa-mir-10b', 'hsa-mir-99a', 'hsa-mir-99b').
